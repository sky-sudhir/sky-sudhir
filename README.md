## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am an **AI Engineer** with a strong foundation in **full-stack software development**, bringing over **3 years of experience** in building scalable, production-grade applications. My passion lies at the intersection of Generative AI and robust software architecture, where I focus on creating intelligent, data-driven solutions that solve real-world problems.

My expertise is in designing and implementing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines, developing **multi-agent systems**, and leveraging modern AI frameworks like **LangChain** and **FastAPI**. I bridge the gap between complex AI models and user-friendly applications by leveraging my background in **React, Next.js, Node.js, and cloud platforms like AWS**.

I am driven by a desire to build the next generation of intelligent software and am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative AI projects.
