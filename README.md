## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate and results-driven **React Developer** with over 3 years of experience building modern, scalable web applications using **React.js**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. I love converting UI/UX ideas into code, leading frontend teams, and exploring modular design patterns and performance optimizations.

Currently working as a **Senior Software Engineer (Team Lead)** at **Quicktouch Technologies**, I thrive at the intersection of code quality, product vision, and team growth.
